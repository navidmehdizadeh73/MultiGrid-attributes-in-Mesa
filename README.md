How to access the attributes of the grid in MultiGrid class in Mesa?
I'll appreciate if someone helps me go through the problem I have faced creating my model in Mesa. Actually, because of the paucity of information about Mesa, I have not noticed how we are able to reach the attributes of the grid. 
I want to add several attributes and consequently import different values for attributes to distinguish cells from each other. In other words, I want to import to have a heterogenous grid and then add my agents in it.
can anyone help me fix this issue?
Thanks!
